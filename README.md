# Blockchain Backend (Ruby)
A block-chain based ticketing app that allows users to purchase (concert) tickets and stores the transaction in the decentralised ethereum network


Summary/Process/Approach/ImplementedFunctionality/Approach to solving the problem:


## Specification

### MVP
Project setup ( Trello, Github, Travis, Heroku, Coverage checkers, Linter)
A simple app that allows a user to see available concert tickets and make a purchase. Initially this will be stored in a 'mock blockchain' i.e. a database.

### First Sprint
```
As a frequent concert goer,
So that I can see what concerts are available,
I want to see a list of available concerts
```
```
As a fan of Spice Girls,
So that I can see them live at a concert,
I want to make a purchase of a ticket
```
```
As a ticket purchaser,
So that I can get into the concert,
I want a confirmation with my ticket number
```
